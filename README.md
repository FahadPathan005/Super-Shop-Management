# Super-Shop-ManagementA simple super shop management project created with java. IDE: IntelliJ

I created this project only to practice. 
But I tried to make the codes easily redable, reuseable and changeable. 
I used File class to handle login information (id and pass) and creating memo for particular user. 
I marked where the codes should change to add or remove some products in future.

java files are here ( src/com/company ).

Main.java is used to run the project. 
UserControl.java is used to work with user and file (login info and memo). 
Products.java is used to control the products of the super shop. 
Others are used to control that type (file name is written as type) of products.
