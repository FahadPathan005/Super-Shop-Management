# Super-Shop-Management
A simple super shop management project.

I created this project to practice.
But I tried to make the codes easily readable, reusable and changeable.

use of classes:
1. Main.java is used to run the project.
2. UserControl.java is used to work with user and file (login info and memo).
3. Mail.java is used to send password for new users and for password recovery.
4. Products.java is used to control the products of the super shop.
5. Others are used to control that type (file name is written as type) of products.

How to run:
(on cmd)
1. run SuperShop.jar on cmd
