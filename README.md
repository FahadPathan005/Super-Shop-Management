# Super-Shop-Management
A simple super shop management project created with java. 
IDE: IntelliJ

I created this project only to practice. 
But I tried to make the codes easily readable, reuseable and changeable. 
I used File class to handle login information (id and pass) and creating memo for particular user. 
I marked where the codes should change to add or remove some products in the future.

java files are here ( src/com/company ).

Main.java is used to run the project. 
UserControl.java is used to work with user and file (login info and memo). 
Products.java is used to control the products of the super shop. 
Others are used to control that type (file name is written as type) of products.

How to run:
clone/ download zip.
open the whole project (folder: Super-Shop-Management-main) on Intellij.
open Main.java ( src/com.company ).
press Ctrl + Shift + F10.
